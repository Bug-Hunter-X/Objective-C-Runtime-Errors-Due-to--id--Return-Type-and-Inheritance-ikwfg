In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with method signatures that involve `id` types, especially when combined with type casting and inheritance.  Consider a scenario where a base class declares a method returning `id` and a subclass overrides it, returning a more specific type. If the caller assumes the base class's return type (`id`), unexpected behavior can occur during runtime if the returned object's methods are accessed without proper type casting.
